"" Tags settings.
" When a tag file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path of
" the current file. This makes it possible to use a tags file in the directory
" where the current file is (no matter what the current directory is).
" The idea of using "./" is that you can define which tag file is searched
" first: In the current directory ("tags,./tags") or in the directory of the
" current file ("./tags,tags").

"set tags=./tags;,tags;,$HOME

"" Key remaps
" Easier split navigations
" We can use different key mappings for easy navigation between splits to save
" a keystroke. So instead of ctrl-w then j, itâ€™s just ctrl-j:
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h

" The following commands map the 'j' key to execute 'gj' and the 'k' key to
" execute 'gk'. These are useful for moving between long wrapped lines.
nnoremap k gk
nnoremap j gj

" Map <C-[> to <C-T> aka :pop command to navigate between tags with <C-]> and
" <C-[>
nmap <C-[> <C-T>

" Search for selected text, forwards or backwards.
